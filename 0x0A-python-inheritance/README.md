# 0x0A Python - Inheritance :snake:

This project covers OOP in python with more complex scripts. This project is about Python class inheritance. It is more about the differences between super- and sub-classes while practicing inheritance, definining classes with multiple base classes, and overiding inherited methods
and attributes.

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object

1. Class MyList that inherits from list

2. Function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.

3. Function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.

4. Function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.

5. Empty class BaseGeometry.

6. Class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).

7. Class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).

8. Class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).

9. Class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)

10. Class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)

11. Class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).

12. Class MyInt that inherits from int

13. Function that adds a new attribute to an object if itâ€™s possible
