# 0x0B Python - Input/Output :snake:

This project has used the builtin with, open, and read functions with the json module to read and write files and serialize and deserialize objects with JSON.

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout

1. Function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written:
2. Function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added
3. Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)
4. Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string
5. Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation
6. A function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”
7. A script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file
8. A function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object
9. A class Student that defines a student public instance attributes
10. A class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)
11. A class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py)
12. Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n
13. A  function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string
14. A script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics
